		<h2>How is chocolate made?</h2>
		<p>We have told you that one of the main and most important ingredients in chocolate is the cocoa butter. However, chocolate has many other ingredients. While you are waiting for your chocolate samples to cool, take a moment to learn about this!. Even though the chocolate making process includes many more steps, we highlight these four because they are most important to the texture and flavor of the final product.</p>

				<td><p>Once the pods are ripe, they are cut down from the trees. Then the pod is split open and bean is removed. Next the beans are fermented for up to 6 days.</p></td>
				<td><p>The beans are roasted to darken the color and to further bring out the flavor of the cacao. After roasting, the shells are removed from the bean, leaving only the roasted cocoa nib, which is the key ingredient for making chocolate.</p></td>
				<td><p>The cocoa nibs are ground into a paste called cocoa mass.That is further processed to separate the fat, known as cocoa butter, from the cocoa solid, leaving cocoa powder. The butter and the solid and then combined again, along with sugar and milk.</p></td>
				<td><p>Chocolate is then "tempered" through a slow decrease in temperature. During this process, the chocolate is cooled and then warmed, until it reaches the correct temperature, creating an even crystallization of fats.</p></td>
