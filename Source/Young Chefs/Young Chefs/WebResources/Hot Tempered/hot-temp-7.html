		<h1>Make Fondue</h1>
				
		<h2>Snack Time</h2>
		<p>The best part of this experiment is that you have tons of delicious melted chocolate left over from when you took the chocolate samples. To make good use of this, chop up some fruits of your choice, for example, 1 banana, 5 strawberries, 1 pear or mango. Dip these into the chocolate and enjoy the delicious combination of fresh fruit and decadent chocolate.</p>

		<h2 style="color:darkred">Good job on finishing this chocolate lesson! Hopefully you made something delicious and learned a tasty bit of science along the way.</h2>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Final Differences</h2>
		<p>Remember that the two chocolate samples that you made today were different because they were heated to different temperatures, which caused fat molecules to align in different ways and produced two different crystals. In case you were wondering, here are some observations that we have made about the two different chocolate samples. Hopefully you will agree!</p>
