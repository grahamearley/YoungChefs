		<h1>The Chocolate Experiment </h1>
				
		<h2>Thinking about Chocolate</h2>
		<p>Grab a piece of chocolate and think critically about chocolate in terms of its taste and texture. First, examine the chocolate visually. Is it shiny or dull? Then, hold the piece of chocolate in your hand and see if it melts (the chocolate should not melt dramatically). Next, slowly eat the chocolate, putting it on your tongue without biting it. Does it melt in your mouth? What is it like when you bite into it?  What is the texture like? Is it smooth or grainy? What does it taste like? </p>

		<h2>The Science of Chocolate</h2>
		<p>Most people consider good chocolate as one that melts in your mouth but not in your hand, has a characteristic glossy appearance, and has a clear “snap” when broken into pieces. In other words, it’s not just the taste, but also the physical characteristics of the chocolate that matter. But where do all these delicious characteristics come from?</p>
		
		<p>The wonderful physical properties of chocolate can all be attributed to the fat molecules in the cocoa butter, one of the main ingredients in chocolate. In chocolate, the fat molecules can align in different ways to produce different types of crystals, which can be thought of as distinct arrangements of these molecules inside the chocolate. There are six different crystal types, but only one of them is desirable because it produces just the right texture.</p>
		
		<p>As you probably already know, molecules gain energy and move around when they are heated, and they then cool down again when the heat dissipates. When fat molecules are heated, they move around and become disordered, and when they are cooled, they lose energy and come together.</p>
		
		<p>Both the heating and the cooling affects the types of crystals that are formed in chocolate; if the fat molecules are heated to just the right temperature (around 34°C), they will have just the right energy and to come together in a nice, orderly crystal structure as they cool down. This organizes the fat molecules into their correct crystal state and gives us great chocolate. If the fat molecules are instead heated to a really high temperature, they will move around in an extremely fast and disorderly fashion with a lot of energy; because of the disorder produced by the high temperatures, the molecules will realign randomly as they cool down, preventing formation of nice and delicious crystals. Instead of just having the fifth crystal state in the chocolate, you will get a random mixture of different crystal states. This makes chocolate feel waxy and melt in your hand, and changes its appearance from shiny to dull. In other words, chocolate is all about the fat molecules and how they are heated to produce crystals as they cool. See the diagram below for a visual explanation:</p>

		<p><em>In this experiment, you observe fat crystallization in action, heating chocolate to two vastly different temperatures to observe how the microscopic properties of the fat molecules influence the macroscopic properties of the chocolate.</em></p>
