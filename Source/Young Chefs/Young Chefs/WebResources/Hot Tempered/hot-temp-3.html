		<h1>Pre-Experiment</h1>
		
		<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
		<p>Today you will do an experiment where you heat chocolate to two different temperatures: 34C, and higher than 60C. Then you will let the samples cool down and compare them to each other. Before we get started, letâ€™s think about some questions.</p>			
		<p>Do you think that heating chocolate to different temperatures will change its physical properties?<br>If so, what do you think these differences will be? Which one will taste better? Which one will melt faster?</p>
