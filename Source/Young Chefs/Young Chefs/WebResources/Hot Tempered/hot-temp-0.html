		<h2>Exploring Transitions in Chocolate</h2>
		
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>What is chocolate? How is it made? Why does it melt in your mouth but not in your hand? Although you might have consumed chocolate at some point, you are probably unaware of the fascinating science behind this decadent food. Chocolate in its basic form is made of cacao powder, cocoa butter, and sugar. While all these ingredients contribute to the delicious taste of chocolate, the cocoa butter is the crucial ingredient responsible for the wonderful texture, e.g the right combination of snap and melting in your mouth. Cocoa butter is composed of fat molecules, and the way that these molecule are aligned determine the texture of the chocolate. In this lesson, you will learn how to carefully control the fat molecules in chocolate, exploring how the macroscopic properties of melting point, appearance, and snap are linked to the delicious science of chocolate. At the end you will make a delicious chocolate fondue with fruits. Yum!</p>
