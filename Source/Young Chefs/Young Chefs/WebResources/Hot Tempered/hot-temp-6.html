		<p>The tempered chocolate in the refrigerator should now be ready, so <b>take pictures of the two samples</b>. Remove chocolate from refrigerator, and critically examine the two different samples of chocolate, holding each piece in your hands and seeing if they melt in your hands, and looking at them and tasting them. The differences between the two samples are subtle, so itâ€™s important that you pay careful attention.</p>
		<p>What are the textures? Does one melt more than the other? <em>How do the two samples differ?</em></p>
		<textarea class="input" rows="4" id="question_sampleDifferences"></textarea>
		
		<p>Hopefully you noticed a difference between the two chocolate samples, in terms of the textures and the melting points. Why do you think this is? What is the explanation for this, on a molecular level? Remember what you learned about fat crystals in chocolate!</p>
