		<h2>Double Check your Ingrediants</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>250 Grams of Chocolate (70% cacao, in bars) (High quality such as Giardelli or Divinity brand recommended). 200 grams are for cooking, and 50 grams are for tasting.</li>
			<li>1 Banana</li>
			<li>5 Strawberries</li>
			<li>1 Pear or Mango</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol class="steps">
			<li/><p>Put 2 cups of water into medium sized saucepan. Put a glass bowl on top of the saucepan. The bottom of the bowl should be just above the water but not touching it.</p>
			<li/><p>With the bowl on top of the pan, bring the water to boil. </p>

			<li/><p>While waiting for the water to boil, chop 200 grams of chocolate bars into small, uniform pieces.</p>

			<li/><p>Once water comes to a strong boil, remove from heat. Be careful throughout this process: remember that you are dealing with hot boiling water.</p>
			<li/><p>Add chopped chocolate to the glass bowl, and stir around using wooden spoon.</p>

			<li/><p><em>Begin taking temperature of chocolate immediately.</em> Make sure to take temperature when the tip of thermometer is completely covered in chocolate, but does not touch the bowl. Chocolate pieces will begin melting immediately when they are added to the hot bowl. Stir rapidly and constantly so that chocolate will melt uniformly.</p>
			<li/><p>Take two large spoonfuls of chocolate from the bowl at around 32-33 degrees Celsius. This should happen in 60 seconds or less.</p>
		</ol>

		<h3>Chef's Tip</h3>
			<div class="slide">
			<p>Remove the chocolate at a few degrees less than the desired temperature because it will continue to heat quickly.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
			
		<ol class="steps" start="8">
			<li/><p>Make sure all of the chocolate is uniformly melted before removing sample. Smooth the chocolate evenly onto a paper plate, as seen below. Make sure that the chocolate is smoothed evenly and thinly on the paper plate.</p>

			<li/><p>Now, put the water bath back onto the stove and turn it on. Heat the chocolate and take two more large spoonfuls of chocolate from the bowl at around 65 degrees Celsius or higher, and smooth evenly onto a paper plate. Make sure that the sample size is a consistent amount and a consistent thickness on the paper plate.   The chocolate should be significantly hotter; however, make sure that chocolate does not burn!</p>
			<li/><p>Put melted chocolate in refrigerator reserve the rest of the melted chocolate in the bowl, for the fruit fondue at the end of the lesson. While waiting for chocolate to cool in the refrigerator, you will learn how chocolate is made. It is now time for the exploratorium!</p>
