        <h2>Collect your data</h2>
        <p>
        Now that the tofu cubes have marinated, it’s time for you to observe them and think about what happened. Cut a cube of each tofu in half, take a picture, and compare the differences in appearance and texture of the tofu. What does it look like? What does it taste like? How the tofu similar or different compared to before you marinated? <b>Take a picture!</b>

        Hopefully, you will notice some changes in the tofu. But why is this? What happened when the tofu was marinating? What do you think would happen if you left the tofu to marinate for even longer? Remember what you learned about diffusion and the movement of molecules!

        The best part of this experiment is that marinating tofu is not only scientifically informative, but also creates a delicious ingredient that can be used for stir-fry. So now it is time to go ahead and make it. You will need ingredients such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 bag snap peas</li>
            <li>2 carrots</li>
            <li>1 bell pepper</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1 zucchini</li>
            <li>You also need a teaspoon olive oil.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        First, heat the saucepan over medium heat on the stovetop. Once pan is warm, add olive oil and spread around with a spatula. Then add vegetables to pan, beginning with ones that take the longest to cook (i.e. onions).
        </p>
        
        Chef’s Tip: When sautéing vegetables make sure to stir the vegetables around with a spatula, flipping the vegetables periodically so that all sides get cooked evenly and nothing burns
        
        <p>
        Once the vegetables have turned a golden brown, remove them from the pan onto a plate and put them aside. Take your marinated tofu out of the refrigerator. Add all of your marinated tofu to your saucepan on medium heat, adding more oil to the saucepan if necessary. Make sure the tofu is lying flat in a single layer. Cook the tofu for 2-3 minutes on one side, flip, and cook for another 2-3 minutes on the other side, or until golden brown. The two pictures below illustrate cooking the vegetables and tofu.

        <p>
        Next, add the sautéed vegetables back into the saucepan and sauté together for an extra minute or until well-mixed and warm throughout. The pictures below represent what it might look like, but of course every stir fry is unique.

        Take a photo of your final stirfry! What does it taste like? What is the color of the tofu now? What about the flavor and the texture?
