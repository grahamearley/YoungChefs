        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Why are you able to smell your grandmother’s chocolate chip cookies before even setting foot in the kitchen? Why does milk not just settle in one part of your coffee? And why does an open can of soda lose its bubbliness after sitting out overnight? Today, you will explore how and why molecules spread, also known as diffusion. First, you make a basic recipe for marinating tofu, a soy product that contains many nutritional benefits and has deep cultural relevance in many East Asian countries. After observing how the marinade spreads through the tofu, you will explore different combinations of vegetables to complement the marinated tofu, while learning about knife skills and stir fry. Let’s get started! </p>
