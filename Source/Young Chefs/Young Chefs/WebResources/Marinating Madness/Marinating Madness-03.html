        <p> Tofu is a relatively bland food, and so people frequently marinate it to spice it up. This is exactly what you will do today. But first, some questions.
        </p>
        <p>
        Have you ever marinated any kind of meat or tofu before? If you have, what happened when it was marinated?  Try to relate what you observed to the concept of diffusion.
        </p>
        <input type="text" class="big-input">
            <p>
            Connect diffusion to taste. Why do people marinate meat or tofu instead of eating it plain? How does the food taste different after it was marinated? Why does the food have more flavor?
            </p>
            <input type="text" class="big-input">
                <p>
                What do you expect will happen when you add the tofu to the marinade? Will it look different? Taste different? Write down your predictions, and remember to take a photograph of the unmarinated tofu.
