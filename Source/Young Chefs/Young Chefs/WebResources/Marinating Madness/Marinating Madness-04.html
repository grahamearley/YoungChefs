        <h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>
		First take the tofu out of the box and drain the water. Then cut the tofu lengthwise into 2 cm thick slabs. Lay the slabs out on paper towels, and pat them down with paper towels, as shown below.

        <p> <b>Chef’s Tip:</b> Make sure that the tofu is very dry before moving on to step #3. This will help it absorb the marinade better as well as improve the texture.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        After drying it, cut the tofu into cubes of relatively equal size, approximately 2 cm by 2 cm. Mix together your desired ingredients to prepare the marinade.  Before putting the tofu cubes in the marinade, TAKE A PHOTO, and then answer the questions: What does it look like? Taste like? What is the color?

        <p>
        Now, to marinate the tofu, add the cubes into the bowl and toss gently. Make sure all the tofu cubes get fully covered in the marinade. See image below.
        </p>
        <p>
        Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit. Ideally, it should sit for at least 30 minutes (and up to 24 hours) but in the interest of time it can sit for less and achieve comparable results for taste. (Note that if you plan on marinating overnight, you should put the bowl in the refrigerator to keep fresh.)
