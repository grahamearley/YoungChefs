        <h2>The Science of Diffusion</h2>
        <p>Particles are always moving. Even in a glass of tap water, the water molecules are moving around the cup randomly due to their kinetic energy, which is the energy possessed by a molecule due to its motion. This kinetic energy explains the constant, spontaneous motion of molecules, the key to why diffusion occurs. </p><br>
        
        <p>Diffusion is the spontaneous movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, without bulk movement of the material. The random movement of particles leads them to disperse and separate through space.</p><br>
           <p>Particles are always moving - even when two liquids are fully combined, the particles are still moving on the microscopic level. Importantly, this movement of particles is random; particles do not “choose” to go to an area of lower concentration from an area of higher concentration. For example, do you expect all the air in a room to ever be squeezed into one corner? Of course not; this would be absurd!</p><br>

        Diffusion happens everywhere, and is very important in the kitchen. For example, by taking advantage of diffusion, you can infuse certain foods with delicious flavors. This is the purpose of a marinade, a liquid mixture of spices or other ingredients usually used to marinate meat or vegetables.  Today you will observe diffusion in action by marinating tofu, a soy product that contains many nutritional benefits and has deep cultural relevance in many East Asian countries.
