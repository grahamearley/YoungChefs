        <h3>Good job on finishing this tofu lesson! Hopefully you made something delicious and learned a tasty bit of science along the way. Remember that the marinade works because of diffusion.</h3>
        
		<p>The random movement of particles leads them to disperse and separate through space. In our case, the delicious and dark-colored molecules of our marinade gradually diffuse into the tofu over time, transforming the white and bland ingredient into something thatâ€™s deliciously crispy and flavorful in our final stir fry. Who thought diffusion could be so fun?</p>
